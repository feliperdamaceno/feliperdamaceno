### Hey! I'm Felipe 🤘🏻

_Senior Front-End Developer | Web Components Enthusiast | UX Passioned_

Experienced developer blending technical expertise with a designer's eye.
Specialized in building high-quality applications using **TypeScript** and
modern web technologies, I thrive on creating scalable, accessible, and
user-friendly digital experiences 🙂.

I'm also a nerd who enjoys retro gaming and listening to some old-school rock! I
believe in living a peaceful life and doing what I can to help others whenever
possible. Of course, I'm also passionate about technology and always looking to
learn new skills and expand my knowledge. I've been into tech since I was a kid,
and I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow and develop my
skills.
